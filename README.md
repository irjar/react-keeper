A clone of Google ‘Keep’ – whenever you have a new idea you can take a note and add it to a Keeper app. 

There is:
o	a header component 
o	a note component with a title and some content
o	a footer components with dynamically rendered year
You can click Delete option on each of the note to delete it.

The content of the note input is showing by default. 
When the user clicks on the content input, then the title input is shown and the “+” button is zoomed in.
